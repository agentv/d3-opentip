# d3-opentip
Demonstration of Opentip use with D3 examples

Original documentation here: http://www.opentip.org/documentation.html

It was difficult to find examples that helped me understand what to do with
Opentip when using D3.

With help from Mark at Stack Exchange 
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38688469/how-to-use-opentip-with-d3)
I was able to to cobble together some bare bones examples that lead to the
solution I needed for my project.

Hopefully this will help someone else as well.
